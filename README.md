# tech-elevator-capstone

# Background
This project is a culmination of Tech Elevator training completed with JPMorgan Chase. The purpose of this training was to provide an introduction to full-stack development. 
In this project, three group members and I designed a website that allows users that own breweries to input information about their breweries and beers they offer. Customers 
can view these breweries and rate their beers. 

The backend of this system was developed in Java, and the frontend with HTML and CSS. JSP was used to create the webpages.
